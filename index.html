        <a>Click on a square to toggle its color and that of its neighbors. The goal is to turn all the squares white. If you get stuck, click the reset button to start over.
            Good luck!</a>

            The process of building this "Lights Out!" game involved various creative choices and challenges. Initially,
            a simple grid of squares was created, each with a click event listener to toggle its color and that of its
            neighbors. The initial challenge was to ensure the game started with a solvable configuration. This was
            solved by implementing a backtracking algorithm that simulates random clicks until a solution is found. To
            enhance user experience, a click counter and win condition with an alert were added. Further challenges
            included optimizing the backtracking algorithm for efficiency and ensuring the game board remains solvable
            after each click. These challenges were overcome by refining the algorithm and implementing checks for
            neighboring squares. Throughout the process, insights were gained into the importance of user experience,
            efficient algorithms, and robust error handling. Overall, the project provided a valuable learning
            experience in applying JavaScript to create a fun and engaging game.</a>
